# Unsteady Flow Simulation

This project simulates unsteady, incompressible flow over a flat plate airfoil using a simplified vortex panel method. The simulation includes unsteady effects such as pitching motion, wake vortex shedding, and time-varying lift and moment.

## Features

- Unsteady flow modeling with pitching motion
- Wake vortex generation and induced velocity calculation
- Time-dependent lift and moment calculation
- Full wake evolution visualization using animated plots
- Noise added to simulate minor disturbances
- Educational demonstration of unsteady aerodynamic behavior
